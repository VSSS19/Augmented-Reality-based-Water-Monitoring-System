# Augmented-Reality-based-Water-Monitoring-System

This project focuses on building an interactive water level monitoring system that combines 
the power of Augmented Reality (AR) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide real-time 
insights in a visually engaging way. The goal is to make water level monitoring more efficient, 
accurate, and user-friendly—especially in settings where manual checking can be inconvenient 
or impractical. 
At the heart of the system is an ESP8266 microcontroller, which reads data from an 
ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level inside a tank. This data is then sent wirelessly to 
the Firebase Realtime Database, ensuring live updates are available at any time. What sets 
this project apart is its use of AR through Unity, allowing users to scan a marker and 
instantly see a 3D model of the water tank, complete with the current water level rendered 
inside it. 
This real-time, 3D visualization offers a better and more intuitive understanding of the tank’s 
status compared to traditional displays. It also opens the door for further enhancements like 
low-water alerts, automatic motor control, and mobile notifications. 
Overall, this system shows how AR and IoT can work together to solve everyday problems. It 
is a simple, cost-effective, and scalable solution that can be adapted for homes, farms, or 
industrial water systems—making water management smarter and more connected.
